# This guide is about contributing and finding new links

### Finding new links
-  Download Fiddler trial from [offical site](https://www.telerik.com/download)
-  Install it just by pressing Next button all the time
-  Open it and go to Tools > Options > HTTPS > enable `Decrypt HTTPS traffic`
-  Install all the certificates
-  Open Realm of the Mad God and play it. Then check all the URLs and their parameters in Fiddler
-  If you find something interesting open an issue or create Pull Request

### Checking links
May take some time but is very useful
-  Open `README.md` file, take root url, paste it in new browser window
-  Add sections like `friends` or `arena` to URL
-  Add needed parametrs and go to this URL
-  If you see an error about missing parameters, message about removed link or something not mentioned in `README.md`  open an issue or create Pull Request
