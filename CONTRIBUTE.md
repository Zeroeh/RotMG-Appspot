# This guide is about contributing and finding new links

### Finding new links
-  Download Fiddler trial from [offical site](https://www.telerik.com/download)
-  Install it just by pressing Next button all the time
-  Open it and go to Tools > Options > HTTPS > enable `Decrypt HTTPS traffic`
-  Install all the certificates
-  Open Realm of the Mad God and play it. Then check all the URLs and their parameters in Fiddler
-  If you find something interesting open an issue or create Pull Request

### Checking links
May take some time but is very useful
-  Open `README.md` file, take root url, paste it in new browser window
-  Add sections like `friends` or `arena` to URL
-  Add needed parameters and go to this URL
-  If you see an error about missing parameters, message about removed link or something not mentioned in `README.md`  open an issue or create Pull Request

### Finding new subdirectories
Finding subdirectories is quite fun, as it opens up a door to potentially a bunch of new urls. It's recommended to use some sort of web crawler or name generator rather than finding these by hand, but if you're smart and know the game topology, finding them by hand can be just as effective.
I created some graphics that should demonstrate how easy it is to get started.
The first image is the result of a subdirectory that does not exist.
